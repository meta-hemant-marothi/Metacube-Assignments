Here's a complete `README.md` file that includes all the necessary steps for setting up your Node.js project:

```md
# Node.js Project with Express and Nodemon

This project sets up a simple Node.js server using Express, with Nodemon for automatic restarts during development.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initialize a Node.js Project
Create a new project and initialize it:

```
mkdir my-node-project
cd my-node-project
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages:

```
npm install express
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

### 3. Create the Server File
Create a `server.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000; // Change the port if needed

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello, Node.js Server is Running!");
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

### 4. Configure Nodemon
Update the `package.json` file to include scripts for running Nodemon:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node server.js",
  "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

### 5. Run the Server
Start the server normally:

```
npm start
```

Run the server in development mode with automatic restarts:

```
npm run dev
```
