# Assignment
Design a class Area to calculate areas for different shapes. It should support following methods
1. Method to return area of a Triangle. Method will receive width and height as double and return computed value as double.
2. Method to return area of a Rectangle. Method will receive width and height as double and return computed value as double.
3. Method to return area of a Square. Method will receive width as double and return computed value as double.
4. Method to return area of a Circle. Method will receive radius as double and return computed value as double.


Assuming that height, width and radius will be greater than zero write proper specification for each method created above. Also assume that these methods may throw ArithmeticException.
